# Pixel Pictures
Wanted to re-create a fun, collaborative game called "Stick-together" https://www.letsticktogether.com/  and have the ability to use any image that I wanted.

JavaScript, React, Nodejs, Express, Jimp, color-convert. 

Can take any image's by its URL, compress it, scan pixels and returns a hexadecimal value representing the colors, convert those colors to RBG then HSL, and finally assign that HSL value to its most closely related color. After that I added an array with all the pixel-colors and added that to the state of my react component. Displayed image pixel-by-pixel using CSS Grid.
